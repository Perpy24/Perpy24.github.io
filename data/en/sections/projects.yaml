  - name: Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
    logo: /images/sections/projects/aml.png
    #role: Contributor
    timeline: "March 2024"
    #repo: https://github.com/Shakya24/Perpy24.github.io/blob/main/Project%20Report-Applied%20Machine%20Learning%20(G5).pdf # If your project is a public repo on GitHub, then provide this link. it will show star count.
    url: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/16ryKweu8u1g7Uo6ltIKe1pJlt8JUhbah/view?usp=sharing"  # If your project is not a public repo but it has a website or any external details url then provide it here. don't provide "repo" and "url" simultaneously.
    summary: The project focused on developing a credit card fraud detection system using machine learning. It involved advanced feature engineering, handling imbalanced datasets, and employing ensemble methods like Random Forest and AdaBoost. The model's effectiveness was enhanced through hyperparameter tuning and iterative learning, achieving high accuracy and recall, thereby providing a robust solution for real-time fraud detection.
